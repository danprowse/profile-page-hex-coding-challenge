# Welcome to the Hex Coding Challenge 💻

## Getting Started 🛠
Everything you need to get setup is within this repository. If you'd prefer not to use the code provided here that is fine. However, if you do use it we ask that you do **_not_** 'Fork' this repository, and instead you clone it.

### Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/hextransforma-healthcare/welcome-to-hex-js.git`
1. `cd welcome-to-hex-js`
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn start`

## Your Task 📝
In order to get to know you we'd like you to create yourself a profile page.

No profile page is complete without the following:
- Your profile picture (can be of anything)
- Your name
- What industry/area have you worked the longest
- Highlight a specific project or accomplishment you are proud of from your past experiences
- What makes you stand out for this role and what do you hope to achieve

## What we'd like to see being used 🕵️‍♂️
- The API
- Jest
- React Hooks
- CSS

## Duration ⏰
You may take anywhere up to 2+ hours on your profile if you wish.

## Submitting your code 📬
Once you're satisfied with your work, please push it up to a public GitHub repository and send us the link.

If you've chosen to clone this repository, use this command to replace the origin URL with a repository URL you've created:
1. `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REMOTE_URL]`
